# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a Movie Recommendation System based on Content Based Filtering Method. The project is done in Python. The project uses the dataset moviesdata.csv having around 4000 entries. The data is first cleaned and then with the help of cosine similarity, we find the similarity score of the movies with respect to the users favourite movie. Then we recommend 20 similar movies to the user from the dataset.
